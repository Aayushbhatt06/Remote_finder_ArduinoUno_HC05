# Remote_finder_ArduinoUno_HC05
Introducing the Remote Finder, an innovative solution designed to help you locate your misplaced remote control effortlessly. This project features a sleek remote cover equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled buzzer, combining modern technology with practical design.

We created this project on a low budget and with limited resources. We used the Arduino Uno board, though its size is larger than ideal for a remote. For a more compact version, you can use an Arduino Nano with an HC-05 Bluetooth module or even an ESP32.

To enhance the project's utility and functionality, we developed the application using the MIT App Inventor.

Components Used:
1. Arduino Uno
2. HC-05 Bluetooth module
3. 3.3V buzzer (as small as possible)
4. Switch


We have provided the application, circuit diagram, and code for this project in this GitHub repository. Simply make the connections, upload the code to the Arduino Uno, and connect the remote through the application. Don't forget to give the application permission to use Bluetooth on your phone.
