# Remote_finder_ArduinoUno_HC05
Introducing the Remote Finder, an innovative solution designed to help you locate your misplaced remote control effortlessly. This project features a sleek remote cover equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled buzzer, combining modern technology with practical design.

We made this project with low budget and respurser so we used the arduino uno board but its size is big for remote so instead of it you can use arduino nano with hc-05 bt module or you can even use the ESP32.

To make our project more useful and powerful we also developed the application through the MIT app inventor.

Components used :- 
1. Arduino Uno.
2. HC-05 bluetooth module.
3. 3.3v Buzzer (as small as possible).
4. switch.

We have provided the application, circuit diagram and code for this project in this github repository so just do connections upload the code to arduino uno and connect the remote through application and dont forget to give permission to the application to use bluetooth in the phone.
